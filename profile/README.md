# RikaiDev

**Human vision. AI execution. Real products.**

We don't use AI to write code faster.
We use AI to build what one person couldn't build alone.

### The Philosophy

**理解 (Rikai)** — Understanding.

We believe the best tools come from deeply understanding a problem, then solving it with whatever works best. Today, that means human judgment paired with AI capability.

- **Human** → vision, taste, decisions that matter
- **AI** → execution, iteration, things that scale
- **Together** → products that one person couldn't ship alone

This isn't about replacing developers.
It's about what one developer can build now.

### Why Open Source

The code is the proof.

Not slides. Not demos. Not Twitter threads.
Clone it. Read it. Run it. Break it.

If AI-native development works, you should be able to see it in the commits.
